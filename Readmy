This was built for development, Login screen.
No unit test(!) sorry
I learned about unit test and it's great , I understand that it's really important for the development process.
I definitely will invest time to learn it and implement in my future code.
Also  I tried a much as possible to comment my code, I believe it's written well and easy to understand.
Its already connect to mongodb and the user: idea password: idea.  ->  npm run dev
